# Selfie App

In this Project, we have implemented parts of a selfie app. We have particularly implemented three features:



### Feature 1: Instagram Filters

For the first feature, we have designed 2 instagram-like filters. 

1. **Pencil Sketch Filter** - This will generate a sketch of the given image as shown in the output below.
2. **Cartoon Filter** - This should produce a cartoonified output of the input image.

Given below is the expected output for the two filters. Looking at the output, you should be able to figure out what processing can produce those results.

### Feature 2: Blemish Removal

This feature involves the development of a blemish removal tool that processes images to remove blemishes or imperfections from facial or object surfaces.
Given below is the expected output for **blemish removal**. Looking at the output, you should be able to figure out what processing can produce those results.


### Feature 3: Chroma Keying

This feature involves use of chroma keying (also known as “green screen” or “blue screen”) to remove a solid-colored background from images or videos and replace it with another background. Chroma keying is widely used in film, photography, and broadcasting to overlay different backgrounds seamlessly.
Given below is the expected output for **chroma keying**. Looking at the output, you should be able to figure out what processing can produce those results.
