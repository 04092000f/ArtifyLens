# Selfie App

In this Project, we have implemented parts of a selfie app. We have particularly implemented three features:

### Feature 1: Instagram Filters

For the first feature, we have designed 2 instagram-like filters. 

1. **Pencil Sketch Filter** - This will generate a sketch of the given image as shown in the output below.
2. **Cartoon Filter** - This should produce a cartoonified output of the input image.

### Feature 2: Blemish Removal

This feature involves the development of a blemish removal tool that processes images to remove blemishes or imperfections from facial or object surfaces.<br>
Given below is the expected output for **blemish removal**. Looking at the output, you should be able to figure out what processing can produce those results.

### Feature 3: Chroma Keying

This feature involves use of chroma keying (also known as “green screen” or “blue screen”) to remove a solid-colored background from images or videos and replace it with another background. Chroma keying is widely used in film, photography, and broadcasting to overlay different backgrounds seamlessly.<br>
Given below is the expected output for **chroma keying**. Looking at the output, you should be able to figure out what processing can produce those results.
