# Selfie App

In this Project, some parts of a selfie app have been implemented. particularly implemented three features have been implemented:

### Feature 1: Instagram Filters

For the first feature, we have designed 2 instagram-like filters.

1. **Pencil Sketch Filter** - This will generate a sketch of the given image as shown in the output below.
2. **Cartoon Filter** - This should produce a cartoonified output of the input image.

### Feature 2: Blemish Removal

This feature involves the development of a blemish removal tool that processes images to remove blemishes or imperfections from facial or object surfaces.

This feature involves the use of chroma keying (also known as "green screen" or "blue screen") to remove a solid-colored background from images or videos and replace it with another background.
